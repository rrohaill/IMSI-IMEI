IMEI: The International Mobile Station Equipment Identity or IMEI, is a number, usually unique to identify. It is usually found printed inside the battery compartment of the phone, but can also be displayed on-screen on most phones by entering *#06# on the dialpad.
IMSI: The International Mobile Subscriber Identity or IMSI /ˈɪmziː/ is used to identify the user of a cellular network and is a unique identification associated with all cellular networks. It is stored as a 64 bit field and is sent by the phone to the network.
UDID: Unique devide ID. Each iPhone or iPod Touch has a Unique Device Identifier (UDID), which is a sequence of letters and numbers that is specific to your device. It's like a serial number but much harder to guess.
